# python2wasm

This directory contains Python implementations of the same kernels as in `rust2wasm/lib.rs`, for experimentation with Python-to-WASM toolchains.

- `vector_add_kernel`
- `vector_add_loop_kernel`
- `matrix_mul_kernel`

These functions are written to be as close as possible to the Rust versions, but Python-to-WASM export is experimental and may require additional setup.
